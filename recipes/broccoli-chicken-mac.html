    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 to 1.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp of butter</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>12 oz of pasta of your choosing</li>
        <li>3 cups of water</li>
        <li>1/2 pound of broccoli florets</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
        <li>1/2 pound of shredded sharp cheddar</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Turn your Instant Pot to the saute setting. As it is heating 
            cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Once ready, add the butter. 
            After the butter is melted, add the chicken and saute for 1-2 minutes. 
            Add in the garlic and turn the saute setting off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add pasta overtop of the chicken into a flat later. Afterwards add the water and 
            cover as much pasta as possible. Next and the pinch of salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a large piece of foil and add the broccoli to the center. Fold over one side 
            of the foil and fold the edges in to seal. Next, fold the other side over top and 
            allow space inside the packet so that the steam can expand. Now the foil packet is 
            complete and can be placed on top of the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
            Close the lid of the Instant Pot and set the valve to "sealing". Set the cook time 
            to 3 minutes. Once that timer is up, wait 5 minutes before turning the valve to 
            "venting." After the steam has escaped, remove the lid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully open up the foil packet and stir in the broccoli, cheese, and milk. Once 
            the cheese is fully melted the meal is complete!
