    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is my go-to recipe when I simply don't feel like cooking. This meal is cheap, 
        takes very little effort, and leaves plenty of leftovers! If you love pasta but don't 
        always love cooking, you will need this recipe in your dinner rotation.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz of thin spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>As many pre-cooked frozen meatballs as desired</li>
        <li>1 jar of Bertolli Tomato and Basil sauce or spaghetti sauce of choice</li>
        <li>1 box of frozen Texas Toast</li>
        <li>Optional: fresh basil and parmesan cheese for added flavor</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First fill a large pot with water and set it on the stove on high. Next, preheat the oven 
            as instructed on the texas toast package.
        </li>
        <li>
            While waiting for the oven and water to boil, take a small pot, add the sauce and meatballs, 
            put on the stove on medium to low heat and cover. Next lay the Texas Toast out on a pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the water is boiling, add the pasta. By now the oven should be preheated and the Texas Toast 
            can be put in. Set a timer as instructed on the Texas Toast box.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir the pasta occasionally and turn down the heat slightly so that the water doesn't boil 
            over the pot. After about 10 minutes, check the pasta to see if it's tender. Add time as needed 
            until the pasta is ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the pasta is ready, strain out the water. Remove the Texas Toast from the oven once the 
            timer is up.
        </li>
        <li>
            By now, the sauce and meatballs should be ready! Fix a plate by taking a desired amount of pasta, 
            add sauce and meatballs, and take a piece of garlic bread. Optionally add fresh basil and parmesan.
        </li>
    </ol>
